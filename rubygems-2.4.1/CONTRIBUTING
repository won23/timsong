= How to contribute

Community involvement is essential to RubyGems. We want to keep it easy as
possible to contribute changes. There are a few guidelines that we need
contributors to follow to reduce the time it takes to get changes merged in.

== Guidelines

1. New features should be coupled with tests.

2. Ensure that your code blends well with ours:
   * No trailing whitespace
   * Match indentation (two spaces)
   * Match coding style (`if`, `elsif`, `when` need trailing `then`)

3. Don't modify the history file or version number.

4. If you have any questions, just ask on IRC in #rubygems on Freenode or file
   an issue here: http://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues

For more information and ideas on how to contribute to RubyGems ecosystem, see
here: http://guides.rubygems.org/contributing/

== Getting Started

Run:

    $ gem install hoe
    $ rake newb

After `rake newb` finishes you can run `rake` to run the tests.
